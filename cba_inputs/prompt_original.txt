## Task Summary:
Indicator Discovery & Selection

Purpose
This tool identifies and recommends the most appropriate indicator(s) to track progress toward a project’s expected outcomes, using the information stored in the Knowledge Base (KB). The selection is guided by existing use cases and optimized to balance accuracy, ease of use, and cost.

⸻

Scope of the Knowledge Base (KB)

The Knowledge Base contains structured information on:
	1.	Indicators
	•	Indicator definitions and intended use
	•	Underlying methods
	•	Attributes including:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Ease of use
	•	Cost
	•	Mappings to principles and criteria
	2.	Methods
	•	Methodological descriptions underlying indicators
	•	Links to scientific publications, i.e., one or more Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) per method
	3.	Use Cases
	•	Example project descriptions
	•	Expected outcomes for those projects
	•	A curated example of “good” indicator sets used to track progress toward those outcomes

Task Description

Given a new project description and its expected outcomes, the tool shall:
	1.	Identify Relevant Use Cases
	•	Search the KB for the most relevant existing use case(s) based on similarity in:
	•	Project objectives
	•	Expected outcomes
	•	Intervention type or thematic focus
	2.	Infer Suitable Indicators
	•	Extract indicators used in the selected use case(s) as reference examples.
	•	Identify additional indicators in the KB that are relevant to the project’s expected outcomes.
	3.	Apply Principle & Criteria Mapping
	•	Indicators in the KB are mapped to Principles (1–7) and Criteria (e.g. 1.1, 1.2 … 7.4).
	•	Mapping strength is encoded as:
	•	P (Primary): Indicator is highly relevant and directly addresses the criterion.
	•	S (Secondary): Indicator supports the criterion but is not the main measure.
	•	x: Indicator is related and applicable, but at a lower degree.
	•	Prioritize indicators with Primary (P) mappings to the most relevant criteria, followed by Secondary (S), and then x mappings where appropriate.
	4.	Optimize Indicator Selection
	•	Evaluate candidate indicators based on:
	•	Higher accuracy
	•	Higher ease of use
	•	Lower cost
	•	Balance trade-offs where no single indicator is optimal across all attributes.
	•	Prefer a concise, complementary set of indicators, e.g., covering all Principles.
    •	Consider the project budget and ambition when selecting indicators.
	5.	Provide Supporting Evidence
	•	For each recommended indicator, reference its underlying method(s).
	•	Methods include links to scientific publications via one or more DOIs.
	•	Note that:
	•	In many cases, the full publication is openly available via the DOI landing page.
	•	In some cases, only the abstract may be accessible.

Expected Output

The tool should return:
	•	A ranked list of recommended indicator(s) suitable for tracking progress toward the project’s expected outcomes
	•	For each indicator:
	•	Brief justification of relevance
	•	Principle(s) and criterion/criteria mapping
	•	Summary of accuracy, ease of use, and cost considerations
	•	References to supporting methods and associated DOI(s)
